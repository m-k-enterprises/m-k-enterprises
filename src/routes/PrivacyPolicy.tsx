          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>
            We collect information that you provide directly, such as your name,

          </p>
          <h2>How We Share Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We may share data with service providers, business partners, or
            affiliates solely to deliver our services. We also disclose
            information if required by law or during business transfers. Third
            parties may use data only to perform services for us and must comply
            with applicable privacy laws.

          <h2>Your Rights</h2>
          <p>
            Under GDPR, you may access, correct, delete, or restrict processing
            of your personal data and request portability. Under CCPA, you have
            the right to know what information we collect, request deletion, and
            opt out of any sale of your data. We do not sell personal
            information. To exercise these rights, contact us at
            privacy@m-k.enterprises. We will verify your request before
            processing it and will not discriminate against you for exercising
            your rights.
          </p>
          <h2>Data Retention and Security</h2>
          <p>
            We keep personal data only as long as needed for the purposes stated
            in this policy. We protect information with encryption, secure
            servers, and other safeguards, though no method is completely secure.
          </p>
          <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

            We may update this policy occasionally. When we do, we will post the
